--[[
    Horizon Suite - Patch Notes Data
    Update this file each release. Key must exactly match ## Version in HorizonSuite.toc.
    In-game notes should be player-facing summaries — not every internal/CI entry.

    Per version table:
    - date = "YYYY-MM-DD" (optional but preferred) — store ISO for CHANGELOG parity; the dashboard shows long UK text
      (e.g. 31 March 2026) in parentheses after the version.
    - Array entries { section = "...", bullets = { ... } } — bullets may use "Module: rest"; the UI capitalizes the
      first letter after ": " when it is lowercase (ASCII). Data can stay lowercase after the colon if you prefer.
    - A bullet that only one client can notice carries the flavour inside the prefix: "Focus (Forever): rest" or
      "Core (Retail): rest". No flavour means both. Every client renders every bullet — do not filter by flavour
      here, or a release that only touches one client shows an empty popup on the other. The renderer colours the
      flavour as its own badge, so write it plainly here and leave the styling to it; a flavour it does not know
      is left as written rather than badged.
